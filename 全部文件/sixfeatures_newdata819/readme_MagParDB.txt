MagParDB README FILE
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
This database includes a total of 323 flaring ARs (106 M/X-class flaring ARs and 217 C-class flaring ARs ) appearing from June
2010 until December 2022 observed by the SDO/HMI. 

Each entry in MagParDB contains the following information:

LON - flare heliographic longitude [DEG] 
LAT -  lare heliographic latitude [DEG] 
ARNUM - active region number   
Confined/Eruptive - C(confined; not associated with a CME)/E£¨eruptive; 
		       associated with a CME£©
E_TOTAL - total photospheric free magnetic
